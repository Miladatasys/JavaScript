JavaScript Essentials
This repository contains code snippets and examples for essential concepts in JavaScript. The following sections provide a brief summary of some of the concepts covered in this repository.

Variables
Variables are used to store data in JavaScript. They can be declared with the let keyword, which has better support for block scope, or with the const keyword, which creates a constant variable that cannot be changed. Variables can be concatenated with the + operator to create a string, and their values can be shown in the console.

DOM Manipulation
To select elements from the Document Object Model (DOM) of a webpage, you can use the querySelector method, which returns the first element that matches a specified CSS selector(s) in the document. Once you have selected an element, you can use its innerHTML property to set or return its HTML content. To ensure that the HTML has loaded before the JavaScript is executed, you can add the defer attribute to the script tag in your HTML file.

Conditions and Loops
Conditions and loops allow you to execute code based on a condition or to iterate through a block of code a certain number of times. For example, the if/else statement allows you to execute code based on a condition, while the for/while loop allows you to iterate through a block of code a certain number of times. The for each loop and for let loop are variations of the for loop that allow you to iterate through the elements of an array or the keys and values of an object, respectively.

Functions
Functions are used to group a block of code and execute it when called. In JavaScript, functions can be declared with the function keyword or with a function expression that is assigned to a variable, such as const print = function() { ... }. Functions can take parameters and return values, and they can be called from other functions or from the main program.

Miscellaneous
Other concepts covered in this repository include using comments to annotate your code, alerting the user with a message, and using arrays to store a lot of data in an ordered list. The code snippets and examples in this repository are intended to provide a starting point for learning these and other essential concepts in JavaScript.
